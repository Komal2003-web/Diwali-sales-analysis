# Diwali-sales-analysis
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data, aimed at uncovering key business insights to enhance customer experience and boost sales during the festive season. I performed this analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset includes customer demographics (age, gender, occupation, marital status), regional data (state-wise sales), and purchase behavior (amount spent, product categories). Through data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation, I identified top-performing states, high-value customer segments, and product categories that drive the most revenue. The findings from this analysis can help businesses target the right audience, personalize offers, and make data-driven decisions for future Diwali campaigns.
